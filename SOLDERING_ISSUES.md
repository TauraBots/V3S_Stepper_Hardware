# Soldering Issues - Purple Stepper Motor Drivers

## Overview
This document tracks issues encountered while soldering the 2-board assembly using purple stepper motor drivers.

## Known Issues

### 1. Purple Stepper Motor Driver Installation
**Issue:** Difficulties during installation of purple stepper motor drivers on the 2-board configuration.

**Symptoms:**
- Driver pins may not align properly with board headers
- Solder bridges may form between adjacent pins
- Drivers may not seat correctly

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Verify driver orientation before soldering
2. Check pin alignment with board headers
3. Use flux to improve solder flow
4. Inspect for solder bridges under magnification
5. Test continuity between driver pins and board traces

### 2. Common Soldering Problems

**Cold Solder Joints:**
- Symptoms: Dull, grainy appearance; poor mechanical strength
- Solution: Reheat joint with proper temperature (300-350°C)

**Solder Bridges:**
- Symptoms: Unintended connections between adjacent pins
- Solution: Use solder wick or desoldering pump to remove excess solder

**Insufficient Solder:**
- Symptoms: Pin not fully wetted; weak connection
- Solution: Add more solder with proper heating

## Recommended Tools
- Soldering iron (adjustable temperature)
- Solder (63/37 or lead-free)
- Flux pen
- Solder wick
- Magnifying glass or microscope
- Multimeter for continuity testing

## Testing After Soldering
1. Visual inspection under magnification
2. Continuity test between driver pins and board
3. Check for shorts between adjacent pins
4. Verify proper seating of drivers
5. Test motor operation with low current

## Additional Notes
- Work in a well-ventilated area
- Use proper ESD protection
- Take breaks to avoid fatigue-related mistakes
- Document any unique issues for future reference
